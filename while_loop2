#Using a while loop, create a list called nums that contains the numbers 0 though 20.
# (i.e: your while looop should initialize a counter variable
# on 0. During each iteration, the loop should append
# the current value of the counter variable to nums
# and then increase the counter by 1. The while loop
# should stop once the counter variable is greater than 20)



nums = list (range(0,21))
sum1 = 0
num = 0

while num < len(nums):
    sum1 += nums[num]
    num += 1
    print(num)
